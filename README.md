Chatbot

Project for IBM-CIC.
The entire project is coded by Kasper Dahl Andersen.
Project entirely written in Java; at the moment I do not have a lot of experience with full-stack development.
The terminal functions as the interface where commands in the form of strings can be inputted.

Run with the following commands:
javac Chatbot.java
Java Chatbot
